## Description
This document describes the API for writing scripts in the application **MotorXP-AFM** for parametric construction of a motor geometry. It includes detailed information on [global functions](globalFunctions_index.md), [built-in objects](globalObjects_index.md), [types of created objects](types_index.md), [materials](globalObjects/Material_index.md), [constants](constants_index.md) and [elements of control](types/widgets_index.md) (UI widgets).
